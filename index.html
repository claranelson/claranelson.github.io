        	<h4>Background</h3>
          <p>I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Ordergroove, where I work on the Merchant Growth team on tools to help our merchants manage their programs and customers manage their subscriptions. This work includes the merchant portal, the subscription offers that appear on product pages for customers to select if they want a subscription, and the customer interface for managing their subscriptions. My work on these tools primarily involves React, Redux, Sass, Python, and Go. Previously at Ordergroove, I also worked on the Shopify integration in Node.js.</p>
        <h4>Experience Summary</h3>
		<p>A full description of my experience can be found <a href = "/experience.html">here</a>.
          <p>Some areas I have experience in:</p>
          <ul>
          	<li>Building websites in React</li>
          	<li>Using Redux for state management</li>
          	<li>Building and debugging templates in Liquid</li>
          	<li>Backend development in Go and Django</li>       
          	<li>Support for internal and external clients</li>
          	<li>Managing conflicting product considerations and working with PM to refine product needs versus engineering complexity</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>About Me</h3>
        <p>I also have quite a few hobbies. I enjoy philosophical discussions and debate, and at Carnegie Mellon I was the president of the Humanist League, an organization that facilitates discussions on a wide array of topics and brings in speakers. I also enjoy writing novels, and have participated 5 times in National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo), a competition where you write a 50,000 word novel in the month of November. I also enjoy playing video games such as Skyrim, Fable, Portal, and the Witcher.</p>
