          <p>I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 2019 with my Masters in Advanced Infrastructure Systems, the intersection between civil engineering and technology. Previously at Carnegie Mellon, I studied civil engineering for my Bachelors. One of the department's specialty was applying sensors, programming, and data analytics to the built environment in the study of 'Advanced Infrastructure Systems', which I soon became fascinated with. As both my coursework and internships included programming components, I gradually realized that I had a genuine interest in programming itself and not just what it could lead towards, leading my to take the computer science course 15-122 on data structures and algorithms in my last semester at Carnegie Mellon.</p>
          <p>After graduation, I moved on to work at ARUP as an Advanced Technology and Research Graduate Analyst. I perform structural and risk assessments of buildings, often using scripts and data analysis to help automate processes, determine design parameters, and determine the behavior of the building. Although my work has allowed me to practice some programming skills and some of the same analytical processes, such as debugging models, I've realized that I most enjoy programming as my primary task rather than a secondary. I'm now working on further developing my skills and am looking for a position that will allow me to code as my primary task. </p>
          <p>I also have quite a few hobbies. I greatly enjoy philosophical discussions and debate, and at Carnegie Mellon was the president of the Humanist League, an organization that organizes discussions on an array of topics and brings in speakers. I also enjoy writing novels, and have participated 5 times in National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo), a competition where you write a 50,000 word novel in the month of November. I also enjoy playing video games such as Skyrim, Fable, Portal, and the Witcher.</p>
