          <p>I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Ordergroove, where I work on the Merchant Growth team on tools to help our merchants manage their programs and customers manage their subscriptions. This work includes the merchant portal, the subscription offers that appear on product pages for customers to select if they want a subscription, and the customer interface for managing their subscriptions. My work on these tools primarily involves React, Redux, Sass, Python, and Go. Previously at Ordergroove, I also worked on the Shopify integration in Node.js.</p>
        
          <p>I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 2019 with my Masters in Advanced Infrastructure Systems, the intersection between civil engineering and technology. I studied civil engineering at Carnegie Mellon for my Bachelors, but gradually moved more and more technical, eventually taking the computer science course 15-122 on data structures and algorithms in C in my last semester at CMU. After graduating, I gradually transitioned into Software Engineering while working. I started in backend and have since moved into a frontend specialization while maintaining by fullstack abilities.</p>
          <p>I also have quite a few hobbies. I greatly enjoy philosophical discussions and debate, and at Carnegie Mellon I was the president of the Humanist League, an organization that facilitates discussions on a wide array of topics and brings in speakers. I also enjoy writing novels, and have participated 5 times in National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo), a competition where you write a 50,000 word novel in the month of November. I also enjoy playing video games such as Skyrim, Fable, Portal, and the Witcher.</p>
