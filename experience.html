      	<p>In my Junior year of college, I took a class on web development with Python. 
      	For the final project, I created a task manager web application with both Kanban and tabular views using Django and JQuery.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Created task manager with stack of JQuery, Django, and SQLite</li>
          <li>Created multiple models and views to allow storage of tasks and task category data</li>
          <li>Created Kanban view using JQuery with tasks sorted into columns and color-coded by category</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I have also created static websites, such as this website and a website showcasing a green building I studied in college.</p>
      	
      	<h3>Data Analysis and Visualization</h3>
        <p>Through my work at Arup and through coursework, I have done the following:</p>

          <li>Visualizing data with Python Matplotlib, Tableau, or Excel charts</li>
        </ul>
      	
      	<h3>Database Development</h3>
        <p>In one of my internships, I taught myself VBA to help with existing databases, and went on to recommend an MS Access database for use in my second internship with a different company. My tasks included:</p>
