      	<h2>Web Development</h2>
      	<p>In my Junior year of college, I took a class on web development with Python. 
      	After an initial project creating a desktop app, I created a task manager web app 
      	with both Kanban and tabular views using Django and JQuery. The user could add and edit tasks and categories.
      	The tasks were able to be color coded by category. SQLite was used for the backend.
      	I chose the project of the task manager myself and added the Kanban view for complexity,
      	as I wanted to create a task manager that I would actually want to use. This is the project that you can see showcased from the Projects tab.</p>
      	<p>Prior to this, I created a static website using a bootstrap template to showcase
      	a green building I was studying.</p>
      	
      	<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
      	<p>I have experience with data analysis and visualization from my work at Arup and 
      	previous work. For example, I have experience downloading weather data from NOAA, 
      	automatically cleaning it, and summarizing it into values and charts for engineering 
      	judgements. I primarily work in Python Pandas for this, but have previously also used R.</p>
      	
      	<h2>Database Development</h2>
      	<p>In one of my internships, I pitched and created an MS Access database to store 
      	information on road improvements. This entailed designing the database UI, designing 
      	data entry forms, designing data retrieval pages, and designing reports that would 
      	summarise the data, along with all related SQL queries. At the end of the internship, 
      	I ensured the code was well-documented and handed the project off to a coworker to 
      	maintain for the client.</p>
