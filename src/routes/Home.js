                <p>I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Ordergroove, where I work on the Merchant Growth team on tools to help  merchants manage their programs and customers manage their subscriptions. This work includes the merchant portal, the subscription offer widgets that appear on product pages for customers to subscribe, and the customer interface for managing their subscriptions. My work on these tools primarily involves React, Redux, Less, Python, and Go. Previously at Ordergroove, I also worked on the Shopify integration in Node.js.</p>

            <Card title="About Me">
                <p>I also have quite a few hobbies. I enjoy philosophical discussions and debate, and at Carnegie Mellon I was the president of the Humanist League, an organization that facilitates discussions on a wide array of topics and brings in speakers. I also enjoy writing novels, and have participated 5 times in National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo), a competition where you write a 50,000 word novel in the month of November. I also enjoy playing video games such as Outer Wilds, Fable, and The Forgotten City.</p>
